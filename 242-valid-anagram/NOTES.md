to solve in O(n) space complexity we can use Hashmaps in this case - 2 hashmaps and then compare
otherwise to do it in O(1) space complexity we can use an array of length 26 denoting the english alphabets O(2n) tc
we use length 26 because because only lower case alphabets are given to us.
In both cases time complexity will be O(n)
